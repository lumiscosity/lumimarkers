**lumiMarkers** is a drop-in Figura script which adds placeable markers. Markers can be customized using an Action Wheel powered menu.

---

### Installation
Download either a release or the latest version of the code, then drop the `lumimarkers` folder into the root folder of the Figura avatar you want to install it for.

To use models with the "disguise as model" feature, place the .bbmodel in the `custom` subfolder of the `lumimarkers` folder. You might want to remove any special parent types beforehand, as lumiMarkers does not strip them - **if your model syncs to your movements and you don't know why, this is the reason!**
